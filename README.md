# Face-Recognition-System

The project “Face Recognition System” has been developed via Python and MySQL. Face recognition is the task of identifying an already detected object as a known or unknown face.
We have used Python for model creation and MySql for database connectivity.

## Importance
Facial recognition is a biometric software application capable of uniquely identifying or verifying a person by comparing and analyzing patterns based on the person’s facial contours. 

We, humans, recognize others by looking at their faces, not by fingerprint or iris scan. As a result, facial recognition technology is less invasive and more natural to integrate into our daily lives and processes.

## Objectives

The main objective of this application are:

-Provides a valuable attendance service for students.

-Reduce manual process errors by provide automated and a reliable attendance system uses face recognition technology.

-Increase privacy and security which student cannot presenting  his friend while they are not.



## Conclusion

The approach presented here for face detection and tracking decreases the computation time producing results with high accuracy. Tracking of a face in a video sequence is done using LBPH algorithm. 

Not only in video sequences, it has also been tested on live video using a webcam. Using this system many security and surveillance systems can be developed and required object can be traced down easily.
